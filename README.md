# Analysis of Rich-Club Organizations in Rat Cerebral Cortex

## Overview
This repository contains the code for analyzing rich-club organizations in the rat cerebral cortex through the comparison of null models. The analysis employs graph theory to study the structural properties of the brain's network, focusing on the identification and significance of rich-club organizations.

## Features
- **Graph Theory Application**: Utilizes graph theory to study the structural network of the rat cerebral cortex.
- **Rich-Club Coefficients**: Identifies rich-club organizations and calculates their coefficients.
- **Null Model Comparison**: Employs null models to normalize and validate the empirical values obtained from the network analysis.
- **Community Detection**: Analyzes modularity and community structures within the cerebral cortex network.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rat-cortex-rich-club-analysis.git
    cd rat-cortex-rich-club-analysis
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open and run the `Final_CNS_CODE_PROJECT.ipynb` notebook to execute the analysis.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Final_CNS_CODE_PROJECT.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The analysis reveals significant insights into the rich-club organizations of the rat cerebral cortex, including:
- The identification of rich-club nodes and their connections.
- Comparison of empirical results with null model data.
- Insights into the modularity and community structure of the cortex.
